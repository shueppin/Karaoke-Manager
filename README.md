# Karaoke Manager

This is a Python tkinter GUI which displays YouTube videos with the click of a button in a browser window using a local flask webserver.  
It is originally designed for Karaoke videos, but it works with very much any YouTube video.

## Usage
1. Install the program by downloading Python 3.12, downloading the requirements and downloading the main.py file.
2. Start the program, which should open a GUI and a browser window. The browser will display a sample video.
3. Input all the songs you want in the GUI. They will be saved.
4. Click "Play Next Song" to show the first video of the GUI in the browser tab.
5. When you're done, close the GUI which will shut down the Flask server.
